## Technologies

This project was developed with python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [StreamLit](https://streamlit.io) - Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time.
* [Data Classes](https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses) - Data classes are one of the new features of Python 3.7. With data classes, you do not have to write boilerplate code to get proper initialization, representation, and comparisons for your objects.
* [Typing](https://pypi.org/project/typing/) - Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and variable type annotations. The notation can be used for documenting code in a concise, standard format, and it has been designed to also be used by static and runtime type checkers, static analyzers, IDEs and other tools.
* [Web3](https://pypi.org/project/web3/) - A Python library for interacting with Ethereum, inspired by web3.js.

Also, I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) code editing to develope it.
